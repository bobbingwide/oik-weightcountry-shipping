Adds per-country and weight based shipping cost calculation method to your WooCommerce store.

## Description 

If your WooCommerce store needs to calculate shipping charges based on cart weight and country of delivery
and you're still using WooCommerce 2.5 or earlier then this plugin is for you.

You can group countries that share same delivery costs (e.g. USA and Canada, European Union countries, etc.) or
set the shipping costs on a per-country basis.

If you're using WooCommerce 2.6 you should use [Weight zone shipping for WooCommerce 2.6](https://wordpress.org/plugins/oik-weight-zone-shipping/)
as this is integrated with Shipping Zones.
